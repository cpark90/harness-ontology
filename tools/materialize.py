"""Build projection of the harness ontology — the DUAL of retrieve.py.

retrieve.py is the READ projection: given a request it emits a bounded
context pack for an agent to read. materialize.py is the BUILD projection:
given a VALIDATED harness it renders an actual runnable harness file tree
(CLAUDE.md + a build manifest) from the composed union.

  retrieve : ontology -> request-scoped context pack (what to READ)
  materialize : validated harness -> file tree (what to BUILD)

Only a validated harness materializes. Before emitting anything we run the
same structured validation validate.py runs; if the union does not PASS we
refuse (non-zero exit). This keeps the build honest: a file tree is only ever
produced from a connected, well-typed, capability-complete graph.

Increment 1 was the SPINE (P1) + template-file references (P2), emitting
CLAUDE.md + MANIFEST.json. Increment 2 (this file) adds first-class roles (P4:
.claude/agents/<role>.md per ho:hasRole), tool implementation refs (P3:
ho:implementationRef fetched/copied into tools/<basename>) and standard/docs
scaffold (P5: ho:scaffold / ho:artifactTemplate fragments rendered into the
tree). See docs/materialize-design.md.

Emitted text is SELF-CONTAINED. Graph text (skos:definition / ho:promptText) may
name a neighbouring node by its authoring token — id:chan-dispatch,
ho:appliesPattern — which disambiguates nodes for the ontology AUTHOR but dangles
for the agent reading the built document. The build therefore renders from a
projection of the graph in which those tokens are resolved to prefLabel/rdfs:label
(see IriTokenResolver); the stored ontology keeps its disambiguation unchanged.

Usage:
    /usr/bin/python3 tools/materialize.py h-techdoc --out build/techdoc
    /usr/bin/python3 tools/materialize.py https://harness-ontology.dev/id/techdoc/h-techdoc \
        --out build/techdoc --format json

Composition honours HARNESS_CATALOG / HARNESS_ROOT_ONTOLOGY exactly like
validate.py and retrieve.py, so a recipe union materializes the same way the
central store does.

    manifest dict. When `lock` is given, implementations are reproduced strictly
    from it (byte-identically, or the build fails); otherwise the selection
    policy is applied and a fresh harness.lock.json snapshot is written.

    Atomicity contract ("nothing half-written"): the whole tree is emitted into
    a sibling temp staging dir (same filesystem as `out_dir`, so the final
    placement is an atomic rename). Every gate — the selection-policy resolution
    and the `--lock` content-hash check — runs while writing into staging. Only
    on FULL success is staging placed at `out_dir`; on ANY failure the staging
    dir is removed and `out_dir` is left untouched (or absent). A previously
    non-existent `out_dir` therefore never appears at all when a build fails,
    and an existing one is never partially overwritten.

    Projection contract: the tree is rendered from the graph PROJECTED through
    IriTokenResolver, so the ontology-internal IRI tokens that graph text uses to
    disambiguate neighbouring nodes are emitted as the readable names the
    document's audience can use (see IriTokenResolver). The stored ontology is
